# MWSD: Multiple Writing Style Detector

 This project implements a solution of detecting numerous writing styles in a text. There are many different ways to measure how similar two documents are, or how similar a document is to a query. The project implements the first algorithm of the article with minor changes, which don't affect the outcomes. This algorithm is suggested in the ["Patterning of writing style evolution by means of dynamic similarity"](http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/gran/papers/Granichin_Pattern_Recognition.pdf) by Konstantin Amelina, Oleg Granichina, Natalia Kizhaevaa and Zeev Volkovich.

## Quickstart

#### Requirements

All dependencies can be installed via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note!** The project was written in Python's version 3.6.8, but there should be no problem with every 3.* or 2.* version.

#### Installation

 As known in all the python packages, in order to install the package run the next command:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

#### Usage

**Note!** There is an [example](example.py) to how to wrap the algorithm with simple main script.

The package provides 4 main features:

## Algorithm

Writing style detection algorithm performs the following steps:
1. The algorithm receives two texts for input.
1. Find the N top keywords using [tfâ€“idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf "tf-idf in Wikipedia")
1. Remove from the texts the stopwords and words that not in the N (initially defined amount)  top keywords.
1. Gather groups of 'L' (initially defined amount)  keywords out of the text.
1. Use word2vec to represent each word as a vector for both documents.
1. Calculate the correlation between all the words in each group (L) using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Each group (L) became a vector of L(L-1)/2 dimensionality.
1. Find an association between the vector and its 'T' (initially defined amount) predecessors, via: <div style="text-align:center">![Association between the vector and its T predecessors](images/zv.png "Association between the vector and its T predecessors")</div>
1. Measure the distance between the documents using: <div style="text-align:center">![Distance between documents](images/dzv_eq.png "Distance between documents") ![Distance between documents](images/dzv_img.png "Distance between documents")</div>
1. PAM (known also as k-medoids) clustering into two clusters.

## Results
